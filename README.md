<h1>What is Agile?</h1>

Agile methodologies were established in 2001 and are used throughout the industry as a way of strategically managing software development. Agile is a set of methods and practices that facilitate iterative, flexible, and dynamic development.

If you are a new developer with an understanding of Object Oriented programming, it's not so far of a stretch to say that Agile is sort of like modular task management. When you hear about self-organizing cross-functional teams, those are words associated with Agile. It's like organizing the work being done in the same way you approach functional programming. If you look at Agile like that a lot of these concepts are going to seem familiar.

<h2>Making Changes Quickly</h2>

Nowadays companies need to compete in a rapidly changing marketplace. We have to consider reacting to and taking advantage of adapting in a fast-paced industry. We need to be ready to make changes and consider...

<ul>
    <li>Cost</li>
    <li>Effort</li>
    <li>Scope</li>
    <li>Time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Waterfall</h2>

Waterfall Methodology is a linear approach to development which we can briefly take a look at to put Agile methods into context.

<h3>Aspects of Waterfall Methodology</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Works well for predictable development.</li>
    <li>Small companies.</li>
    <li>Longer development cycles.</li>
    <li>Woks linearly.</li>
    <li>Make the documentation, begin development, work step by step.</li>
    <li>More wait time.</li>
    <li>Cumberson, making changes is more involved.</li>
    <li>Testing stages are delayed.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Client Side</h3>

Agile emphasizes maintaining working products over creating comprehensive documentation. This makes creating documentation easier in the long wrong because it is delayed until the product is up and running. We make better use of customer's feedback and have a collaborative relationship with them. This means having more frequent updates and deliveries.

<h3>Developer Side</h3>

Agile Methodology gives teams more responsibility, ownership, freedom, autonomy, and trust. This means that soft skills are more important and face-to-face communication is prioritized. Teams can work simultaneously on different objectives-- different working pieces. This modular approach relies on simplicity in design.

There is greater transparency when users observe changes incrementally. This allows them to give feeback for effectively. Clients can illuminate what features are a priority, those can be developed first, which raises the value of the product.

We can also more easily predict when things will be completed and how much things will cost.

<h2>Agile Methodologies Overview</h2>

<h3>Scrum</h3>

A framework for implementing ideas, reflecting, and making adjustments. Allows for incorporating practices from other frameworks. Works when cross-functional teams are coordinating multiple "sprints" or 2-4 week chunks of development.

<h3>Extreme Programming (XP)</h3>

Works well when there are changing requirements for the software. Minimizes risk due to new technoligies.

<h3>Kanban</h3>

Visual workflow for organizing teams and prioritizing objectives transparently and efficiently.

Good for adapting to a changing environment.

<h3>Lean</h3>

Tools and principles that can be used to ensure the work being done is the work that will provide the maximium value. Eliminating waste by reducing waiting time and extraneous efforts.

<h3>Crystal</h3>

Approach to development through the lens of people and their interactions. Allows teams to optimize their workflow based on the specific requirements of the project. Focuses on communication, integration, and user involvement.

<h1>Scrum</h1>

There may be a problem with our product and the consumer is not happy. We need to react now. We are going to make the changes immediately even if we are midway through another batch of work and even if the documentation does not reflect the new changes.

<h3>History of Scrum</h3>

1986 - Scrum is first introduced in Japan.

1995 - First early versions of Agile appear.

2001 - Agile Alliance & first formal appearance of Agile methodoligies with scrum.

2002 - Scrum Alliance & certifications added.

2006 - Scrum Inc. offers certification courses privately.

2009 - Scrum.org offers those certification courses (online?).

2010 - First Scrum Guide is published and freely available.

The methodology has changed throughout its history. Agile has become more important over time.

<h2>What is Scrum?</h2>

A framework that enables teams to work together and learn from their specific experiences.

Scrum organizes around producing deliverables efficiently and taking stock based on this loop. Projects are divided into smaller units called sprints. Daily scrum meetings may occur (sometimes called standups) where the sprint backlog and user feedback are reviewed.

What did we do yesterday? What will we do today? Everyone is sharing their updates so that teams are empowered to be self-organizing and all members understand what is going on with each other member. Each member is able to adjust their own strategy based on their counterparts.

<h3>Scrum <em>Roles</em></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Product Owner</li>
    <li>Scrum Master</li>
    <li>Scrum Team</li>
</ul>

Each role has its own objectives and focus.

The <strong>Product Owner</strong> is focused on determining what the features are, organizing a list of priorities, and deciding what needs to be accomplished during each sprint. Adding user stories into the backlog.

The <strong>Scrum Master</strong> helps the team apply scrum, removes barriers for the team, and ensures the team is using agile practices and not being interfered with.

The <strong>Scrum Team</strong> work together to meet the requirements outlined by the product owner and stakeholders.

<h3>Scrum <em>Artifacts</em></h3>

Sort of our internal documents for organizing our objectives. "Artifact" is in this sense an effective word for what the following are.

<strong>Product Backlog</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Full list of deliverables.</li>
    <li>New features and changes to be made.</li>
    <li>Bug Fixes</li>
    <li>Changes to Infrastructure</li>
    <li>Updated as the project develops. Dynamic.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Sprint Backlog</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Subset of Product Backlog</li>
    <li>Deliverables for this sprint.</li>
    <li>Negotiated between the team and product owner.</li>
    <li>Deciding on timelines</li>
</ul>

<strong>Product Increment</strong>
<ul>
    <li>What is already delivered + what we gained in this sprint.</li>
    <li>More or less what was once in the product backlog but has now been completed is in the product increment.</li>
    <li>A product increment should leave the software in a usable state. (release but not necessarily deployment)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scrum <em>Framework</em></h3>

This is like the workflow, timeline, loop, or path we follow when using Scrum.

This is how we incrementally move through the development cycle. It's like a fractal by which I mean the smaller scale processes resemble the larger scale processes. We take the idea of moving a product from start to finish and do it many times within the development cycle.

1) Product Backlog - Orient ourselves with respect to the goals of the project and demands of the stakeholders.
2) Sprint Planning - Determine what tasks from the Product Backlog to put on the Sprint Backlog.
3) Sprint Backlog - What actually made it into our goals for this sprint from the planning stage.
4) Daliy Scrums - What do we aim to acheive in these 24 hours? What did we accomplish in the last 24 hours? This should take 10 minutes or so (sometimes called "timeboxed"). The Product Owner (PO) may sit in but does not play an active role in these check-ins.
5) Sprint Review - Once the sprint is complete we take stock of what we have accomplished. Everyone, the product owner, srum master, and team, altogether.

Then the product owner speaks with the stakeholders and is able to make changes to the Product Backlog for moving forward.

6) Sprint Retrospective - What went well? What went wrong? What can we learn and what mistakes can we avoid before moving to the next sprint. This step is documented.

Once we have done all of this we have a Product Increment.

&nbsp;

We can use a <strong>Scrum Board</strong> to visualize everything on the Sprint Backlog, showing all items during the daily scrum, and made available to all members of the team.

Typically this board is organized into "to do", "started", and "finished" sections (like a kanban board).

We look at the Scrum Board during our daily Scrum Meetings, and there is a strong emphasis on communicating to team members any areas we may be stuck-- however the daily meeting is not a setting for resolving these issues, that can be done afterwards in smaller groups or pairs.

We make a new Scrum Board for each sprint.

<em>It is advisable to use a scrum approach anytime we are moving quickly and making a lot of changes or involving the consumer's feedback regularly.</em>

<h2>Review</h2>

Agile Project Management is a flexible approach to building a project. Think of this as the scope immediately above our Scrum practices.

<ul>
    <li>Project Planning - Breaking the project into tasks, sprints, and estimating timeframes.</li>
    <li>Roadmap Creation - How the project should evolve over time until it has all the features required.</li>
    <li>Release Planning - Releases after each sprint, with later sprints being shorter.</li>
    <li>Sprint Planning - deciding what to do in the current sprint.</li>
    <li>Daily Meetings - Making adjustments as we go during sprints.</li>
    <li>Sprint Meeting & Retrospective - One meeting with stakeholders to share the release, and one to talk about what went well and what did not.</li>
<ul>

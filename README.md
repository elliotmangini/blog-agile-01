<h1>What is Agile?</h1>

Agile methodologies were established in 2001 and are used throughout the industry as a way of strategically managing software development. Agile is a set of methods and practices that facilitate iterative, flexible, and dynamic development.

If you are a new developer with an understanding of Object Oriented programming, it's not so far of a stretch to say that Agile is sort of like modular task management. When you hear about self-organizing cross-functional teams, those are words associated with Agile. It's like organizing the work being done in the same way you approach functional programming. If you look at Agile like that a lot of these concepts are going to seem familiar.

<h2>Making Changes Quickly</h2>

Nowadays companies need to compete in a rapidly changing marketplace. We have to consider reacting to and taking advantage of adapting in a fast-paced industry. We need to be ready to make changes and consider...

<ul>
    <li>Cost</li>
    <li>Effort</li>
    <li>Scope</li>
    <li>Time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Waterfall</h2>

Waterfall Methodology is a linear approach to development which we can briefly take a look at to put Agile methods into context.

<h3>Aspects of Waterfall Methodology</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Works well for predictable development.</li>
    <li>Small companies.</li>
    <li>Longer development cycles.</li>
    <li>Woks linearly.</li>
    <li>Make the documentation, begin development, work step by step.</li>
    <li>More wait time.</li>
    <li>Cumberson, making changes is more involved.</li>
    <li>Testing stages are delayed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Agile</h2>

<h3>Aspects of Agile Methodology</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Smaller teams working on bite-sized objectives.</li>
    <li>Modular work ensures quality.</li>
    <li>Easier to make changes.</li>
    <li>Easier to respond to the market.</li>
    <li>Better for the end-user.</li>
    <li>Using a more flexible plan.</li>
    <li>Deliver to the customer faster.</li>
    <li>Unit tests are easier.</li>
    <li>Predefined Schedule</li>
    <li>Predictable Costs</li>
    <li>High Visibility and High Transparency</li>
    <li>Profuct backlog is flexible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client Side</h3>

Agile emphasizes maintaining working products over creating comprehensive documentation. This makes creating documentation easier in the long wrong because it is delayed until the product is up and running. We make better use of customer's feedback and have a collaborative relationship with them. This means having more frequent updates and deliveries.

<h3>Developer Side</h3>

Agile Methodology gives teams more responsibility, ownership, freedom, autonomy, and trust. This means that soft skills are more important and face-to-face communication is prioritized. Teams can work simultaneously on different objectives-- different working pieces. This modular approach relies on simplicity in design.

There is greater transparency when users observe changes incrementally. This allows them to give feeback for effectively. Clients can illuminate what features are a priority, those can be developed first, which raises the value of the product.

We can also more easily predict when things will be completed and how much things will cost.

<h2>Agile Methodologies Overview</h2>

<h3>Scrum</h3>

A framework for implementing ideas, reflecting, and making adjustments. Allows for incorporating practices from other frameworks. Works when cross-functional teams are coordinating multiple "sprints" or 2-4 week chunks of development.

<h3>Extreme Programming (XP)</h3>

Works well when there are changing requirements for the software. Minimizes risk due to new technoligies.

<h3>Kanban</h3>

Visual workflow for organizing teams and prioritizing objectives transparently and efficiently.

Good for adapting to a changing environment.

<h3>Lean</h3>

Tools and principles that can be used to ensure the work being done is the work that will provide the maximium value. Eliminating waste by reducing waiting time and extraneous efforts.

<h3>Crystal</h3>

Approach to development through the lens of people and their interactions. Allows teams to optimize their workflow based on the specific requirements of the project. Focuses on communication, integration, and user involvement.

<h1>Scrum</h1>

There may be a problem with our product and the consumer is not happy. We need to react now. We are going to make the changes immediately even if we are midway through another batch of work and even if the documentation does not reflect the new changes.

<h3>History of Scrum</h3>

1986 - Scrum is first introduced in Japan.

1995 - First early versions of Agile appear.

2001 - Agile Alliance & first formal appearance of Agile methodoligies with scrum.

2002 - Scrum Alliance & certifications added.

2006 - Scrum Inc. offers certification courses privately.

2009 - Scrum.org offers those certification courses (online?).

2010 - First Scrum Guide is published and freely available.

The methodology has changed throughout its history. Agile has become more important over time.

<h2>What is Scrum?</h2>

A framework that enables teams to work together and learn from their specific experiences.

Scrum organizes around producing deliverables efficiently and taking stock based on this loop. Projects are divided into smaller units called sprints. Daily scrum meetings may occur where the sprint product backlog and user feedback are reviewed.

What did we do yesterday? What will we do today? Everyone is sharing their updates so that teams are empowered to be self-organizing and all members understand what is going on with each other member. Each member is able to adjust their own strategy based on their counterparts.

<h3>Scrum Roles</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Product Owner</li>
    <li>Scrum Master</li>
    <li>Scrum Team</li>
</ul>

Each role has its own objectives and focus.

The <strong>Product Owner</strong> is focused on determining what the features are, organizing a list of priorities, and deciding what needs to be accomplished during each sprint. Adding user stories into the backlog.

The <strong>Scrum Master</strong> helps the team apply scrum, removes barriers for the team, and ensures the team is using agile practices and not being interfered with.

The <strong>Scrum Team</strong> work together to meet the requirements outlined by the product owner and stakeholders.
